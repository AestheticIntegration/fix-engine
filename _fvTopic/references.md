Traditionally, the application of formal verification has been reserved to highly specialised teams (often with PhDs in the subject) in academia, institutions such as NASA, and safety-critical industries such as avionics and microprocessor design.
 
At AI, our mission is to democratize formal verification, bringing its power to new industries in a user-friendly and scalable way. These applications to new industries are powered by recent advances, including CDCL-based Satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving, nonlinear decision procedures and scalable techniques for symbolic execution.

For more on our vision for formal verification for finance, see our short explainer [video](https://vimeo.com/123746101).

AI has published several technical white papers about current application of FV to financial markets:
- [Case Study: 2015 SEC Fine Against UBS ATS](https://www.imandra.ai/case-study-2015-sec-fine-against-ubs-ats/)
- [Transparent Order Priority and Pricing](https://www.imandra.ai/transparent-order-priority-and-pricing/)
- [Creating Safe and Fair Markets](https://www.imandra.ai/creating-safe-and-fair-markets/)

AI has also written several public comments to regulatory proposals by the SEC and CFTC:
- [Response to Proposed Rule, Regulation Automated Trading (“Regulation AT”) RIN 3038-AD52](https://www.imandra.ai/ai-submits-reg-at-comment-letter/)
- [Response to Release No. 34-76474](https://www.imandra.ai/ai-submits-reg-ats-n-comment-letter/)

If you're interested in further background on techniques underlying Imandra, see the following academic papers:

- [Collaborative Verification-Driven Engineering of Hybrid Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6085)

For a great non-technical introduction to the discipline of formal verification and some of its history, we recommend ["Mechanizing Proof"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mechanizing-proof) by Donald Mackenzie.
