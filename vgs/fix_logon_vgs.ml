    Logon VG.2

    "The session acceptor must be prepared to immediately begin processing messages after receipt 
    of the Logon. The session initiator can choose to begin transmission of FIX messages before 
    receipt of the confirmation Logon, however it is recommended that normal message delivery 
    wait until after the return Logon is received to accommodate encryption key negotiation."

    Notes: We take the strict interpretation (i.e. the recommendation in this case) that an
    application message may not be transmitted until counterparty replies with a Logon message
    (in the case that the engine is the initiator).

    "After authentication, the initiator and acceptor must synchronize their messages through
    interrogation of the MsgSeqNum field before sending any queued or new messages. A comparison 
    of the MsgSeqNum in the Logon message to the internally monitored next expected sequence 
    number will indicate any message gaps. Likewise, the initiator can detect gaps by comparing 
    the acknowledgment Logon messageâ€™s MsgSeqNum to the next expected value. The section on 
    message recovery later in this document deals with message gap handling."

    "If the session acceptor has chosen to change the session encryption key, the session initiator 
    must send a third Logon back to the other side in order to acknowledge the key change request. 
    This also allows the session acceptor to know when the session initiator has started to encrypt 
    using the new session key. Both parties are responsible for infinite loop detection and prevention 
    during this phase of the session."

    Notes: we break up the statement into the following VGs:
    - 4.1 - If a confirmation Logon is received with a different encryption key, then another Logon is sent
    back with the same key. Also, we increment the 'fe_num_logons_sent' counter.
    - 4.2 - When the engine attempts to send out a Logon message when the count is violated, it would
    transition into error mode with status change.

    Logon VG.5

    "NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) is used as follows:
    In its Logon request the session initiator supplies in NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) the value 
    next expected from the session acceptor in MsgSeqNum (34). The outgoing header MsgSeqNum (34) 
    of the Logon request is assigned the next-to-be-assigned sequence number as usual.
    
    The session acceptor validates the Logon request including that NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) 
    does not represent a gap. It then constructs its Logon response with NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) 
    containing the value next expected from the session initiator in MsgSeqNum (34) having incremented 
    the number above the Logon request if that was the sequence expected. The outgoing header MsgSeqNum (34)
    is constructed as usual. The session initiator waits to begin sending application messages until 
    it receives the Logon response. When it is received the initiator validates the response including 
    that NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) does not represent a gap.
    
    Both sides react to NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) from its counterparty thus:
    - If equal to the next-to-be-assigned sequence, proceed sending new messages beginning with that 
        number.
    - If lower than the next-to-be-assigned sequence, 'recover' (see 'Message Recovery') all messages 
        from the the last message delivered prior to this Logon through the specified NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (789) 
        sending them in order; then Gap Fill over the sequence number used in Logon and proceed sending 
        newly queued messages with a sequence number one higher than the original Logon.
    - If higher than the next-to-be-assigned sequence, send Logout to abort the session.

    Neither side should generate a ResendRequest based on MsgSeqNum (34) of the incoming Logon message 
    but should expect any gaps to be filled automatically. If a gap is produced by the Logon message 
    MsgSeqNum (34), the receive logic should expect the gap to be filled automatically prior to receiving
    any messages with sequences above the gap."
